Hi, I'm Leo!

This is my clone of Google home page. It's the first project I'm doing for The Odin Project course. And I'm loving it so far. If someone is looking for learn Web Development check https://www.theodinproject.com

live version in https://leoc01.github.io/google-homepage/

In this project the focus was to learn CSS tools like Grid, Flexbox and how to use these to have a goot layout.

I also learned how to remove default styles from the browser like button and input field and re-style them to look how I need to.
